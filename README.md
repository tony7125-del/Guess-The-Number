🎮 Guess the Number — Python Game
📌 Overview

This project is a simple Python game created in a Jupyter Notebook.
The computer randomly selects a number, and the player must guess it.
After each guess, the game gives feedback until the correct number is found.

It’s a great beginner practice project for:

Variables

Loops

Conditionals

Random number generation

User input

🧠 How the Game Works

The program chooses a random number (usually between 1 and 100).

The user enters guesses.

The program tells you if your guess is:

Too high

Too low

Correct

The loop continues until you guess the number.
